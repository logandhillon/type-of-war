 * A GameObject may be used over an (independent) Entity for objects that do not need to be handled by the GameScene,
 * rather, a parent Entity. For instance, {@link PlayerObject} is a child of {@link RopeEntity}.

 * Finally, a GameObject can only be rendered by other objects within the {@link com.logandhillon.typeofwar.entity}
